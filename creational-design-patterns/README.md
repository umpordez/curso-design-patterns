## Abstract Factory
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

## Builder
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so
that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Factory Method
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instation to
subclasses.

## Prototype
Speicify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
and create new objects by copying this prototype

## Signleton
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access
to it.
