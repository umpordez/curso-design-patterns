## Adapter
Conver the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces.

## Bridge
Decouplke an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can
vary independent.

## Composite
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Composite lets clients treat indiviudal objects and compositions of objects
uniformly.

## Decorator
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending
functionality.

## Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem
easier to use.

## Flyweight
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

## Proxy
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
